# Angular online store project
  

## Intro :
  
Searching in different places or different websites for your 
needs take a lot of time and a lot of effort, so we decide to 
save your time and your effort and make one place to reach 
all your need ... One Place Store
  

## Project Idea :
  
This is an Online Store, that displays a lot of different products 
of different categories, which offers you to reach your products according to the targeted category.
  
  
## How it works ...?
  
The project depends totally on the front-end only without the 
back-end so any data stored is stored in (browser local storage) as your mode (dark-light).
The products viewed on the website are from a fake API (dummyJSON).
  

## Experience from the project :

project.
  

## Challenges :    
  
The main challenge was to learn more about angular and to make a project. Also, it was the first time to use TypeScript
